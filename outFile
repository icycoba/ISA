&lt;p&gt;After extensive research, I can conclusively state that this would be a violation of your rental car agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, a quick rewatch of &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt; (1997) suggests that the Atlantic Ocean is more than two feet deep.

&lt;p&gt;As you built your bridge out in
to the deep ocean, the cars on the bottom of the stack would be crushed. The pressure crushing them wouldn&amp;#39;t be the water pressure. Once the windows broke and the interior of the car flooded, the pressure would equalize and the cars would hold their shape, relatively unaffected by the weight of the ocean above them. Instead, what would crush the cars would be the weight of the other cars sitting on top of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when they&amp;#39;re underwater, cars weigh a lot. About 50% of the weight of modern cars is steel and iron, which is much denser than water,&lt;span&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt; so submerged cars are still quite heavy—about 60% to 70% of their surface weight, depending on their exact composition. The cars on the bottom of a mile-high stack would be subjected to extreme pressures, even greater than what they experience in hydraulic car crushers. Those crushers&lt;span&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt; are capable of flattening a car into a pancake a foot or two thick, and the same thing woulto the deep ocean, the cars on the bottom of the stack would be crushed.

&lt;p&gt;The first part of your bridge to Europe would be over the continental shelf, where the water is relatively shallow—just a few hundred crushed cad happen to the cars on the bottom of our stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d still need a lot of cars to form this shallow-water portion of the bridge; getting out to the edge of the continental shelf would take about a billion of them, which is probably close to the total number of cars in the world. Parking lots hold about 1 car per 30 square meters, so a billion cars would cover a large portion of eastern Massachusetts.&lt;span&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the continental shelf, the water gets a lot deeper. The deep-ocean portion of your bridge would require a lot more cars—likely about a trillion of them. This is far more cars than exist in the world; a parking lot big enough to hold them would take up most of the Earth&amp;#39;s land area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can&amp;#39;t rent anywhere close to a billion &lt;em&gt;orrs deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the same thing that saves us from falling pennies also generally protects us from hailstones: Air resistance. As they fall, both pennies and hailstones quickly reach terminal velocity, the speed at which drag balances out gravity and prevents them from speeding up any more. For a small hailstone the size of a pea or a marble, terminal velocity might be only 10 or 20 miles per hour, the speed of an object tossed across a room. Getting hit by them isn&amp;#39;t comfortable, but it&amp;#39;s not likely to cause serious injury.&lt;span&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That high-energy particle released by the expiring potassium atom&lt;span&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt; will promptly bonk&lt;span&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt; into other atoms, leaving everything vibrating with extra heat energy. In theory, you could use this heat energy to do work—that&amp;#39;s how the Mars rovers Curiosity and Opportunity are powered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mars rovers use plutonium, which decays millions of times per second, releasing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of power. By comparison, the 15 decays per second from one banana work out to a couple of picowatts of power, roughly the power consumption of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(power)#Below_1_W&#34;&gt;a single human cell&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The potassium-40 in bananas is a terrible source of energy. But that&amp;#39;s okay, because you know what&amp;#39;s a great energy source? The banana itself! A 
banana contains about 100 calories of food energy, and if you &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/12/2119&#34;&gt;incinerate whole bananas as fuel&lt;/a&gt;, it would only take about 10 bunches per day to keep your house running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for New York City, which we buried in bananas a moment ago while trying to make the radiation idea work (sorry!), radioactivity vs chemical energy isn&amp;#39;t an either/or thing. If you piled up a lot of bananas, they would start to release that chemical energy, one way or another. The sun-baked banana pile would start to rot. The heat from the bananas decomposing in the atmosphere would immediately swamp the heat from radioactivity. The sun-dried bananas would dry, crack, and eventually burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s get a few things out of the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life, we can&amp;#39;t put a metal pole between the Earth and the Moon.&lt;span&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt; The end of the pole near the Moon would be pulled toward the Moon by the Moon&amp;#39;s gravity, and the rest of it would be pulled back down to the Earth by the Earth&amp;#39;s gravity. The pole would be torn in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s one more problem:&lt;span&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt; The Moon doesn&amp;#39;t always stay the same distance from Earth. Its orbit takes it closer and farther away.

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s ignore those problems! What if we had a magical pole that dangled from the Moon down to just above the Earth&amp;#39;s surface, expanding and contracting so it never quite touched the ground? How long would it take to slide down from the Moon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stood next to the end of the pole on the Moon, a problem would become clear right away: You have to slide &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; the pole, and that&amp;#39;s not how sliding works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of sliding, you&amp;#39;ll have to climb.&lt;/p&gt;

;.&lt;span&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt; On the Moon, gravity is much weaker, so it will probably be easier to climb. On the other hand, you&amp;#39;ll have to wear a spacesuit, so that will probably slow you down a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you climb up the pole far enough, Earth&amp;#39;s gravity will take over and start pulling you down. When you&a
mp;#39;re hanging onto the pole, there are three forces pulling on you: The Earth&amp;#39;s gravity pulling you toward Earth, the Moon&amp;#39;s gravity pulling you away from Earth, and centrifugal force&lt;span&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt; from the swinging pole pulling you away from Earth.&lt;span&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt; At first, the combination of the Moon&amp;#39;s gravity and centrifugal force are stronger, pulling you toward the Moon, but as you get closer to the Earth, Earth&amp;#39;s gravity takes over. The Earth is pretty big, so you reach this point—which is known as the L1 Lagrange point—while you&amp;#39;re still pretty close to the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;In countries with right-hand drive spacecraft, these points are referred to as R1 through R5.&#34; src=&#34;https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/157/l1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for you, space is big, so &amp;quot;pretty close&amp;quot; is still a long way. Even if you climb at better-than-world-record speed,
 it will still take you several years to get to the L1 crossover point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you approach the L1 point, you&amp;#39;ll start to be able to switch from climbing to pushing-and-gliding: You can push once and then coast a long distance up the pole. You don&amp;#39;t have to wait to stop, either—you can grab the pole again and giv it will still take you several years to get to the L1 crossover point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, as you reach the vicinity of the L1 point and are no longer fighting gravity, the only limit on your speed will be how quickly you can grab the pole and &amp;quot;throw&amp;quot; it past you. The best baseball pitchers can move their hands at about 100 mph while flinging objects past them, so you probably can&amp;#39;t expect to move much faster than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: While you&amp;#39;re flinging yourself along, be careful not to drift out of reach of the pole. Hopefully you brought some kind of safety line so you can recover if that happens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another few weeks of gliding along the pole, you&amp;#39;ll start to feel gravity take over, speeding you up faster than you can go by pushing yourself. When this happens, be careful—soon, you&amp;#39;ll need to start worrying about going &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; fast.&lt;/p&gt;

The Moon&amp;#39;s orbit is tilted by about 5° relative to the Earth-Sun plane, while the Earth&amp;#39;s axis is tilted by 23.5°. This means that the Moon&amp;#39;s latitude changes the way the Sun&amp;#39;s does, moving from the northern tropics to the southern tropics twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Moon&amp;#39;s orbit is also tilted, and this tilt rotates on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle&#34;&gt;an 18.9-year cycle&lt;/a&gt;. When the Moon&amp;#39;s tilt is in the same direction as the Earth&amp;#39;s, it stays 5° closer to the Equator than the Sun, and when it&amp;#39;s in the opposite direction, it reaches more extreme latitudes. When the Moon is over a point farther from the equator, it has a lower &amp;quot;ground speed,&amp;quot; so the lower end of the sine wave goes lower.

People often ask why we don&amp;#39;t use rockets to slow down, to avoid the need for a heat shield. You can read this article for an explanation, but the bottom line is that changing your speed by 11 km/s takes either a tank of fuel the size of a building or a tiny heat shield, and the tiny heat shield is a lot easier to carry.

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, people didn&amp;#39;t really notice that electrofishing injured fish at all. For the most part, stunned fish seemed to be fine after a few minutes. However, they frequently suffer from internal damage which isn&amp;#39;t obvious from the outside. The electric current causes involuntary muscle spasms, which can fracture the fish&amp;#39;s vertebrae.

&lt;p&gt;As you mention, for a given
 electrofishing setup, larger fish are usually more affected than smaller ones.&lt;span&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt; Why? Well, we don&amp;#39;t know. In their comprehensive 2003 study &lt;em&gt;Immobilization Thresholds of Electrofishing Relative to Fish Size&lt;/em&gt;, biologists Chad Dolan and Steve Miranda modeled the way electric currents stun fish electrofishing setup, larger fish are usually more affected than smaller ones.&lt;span&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt; Why? Well, we don&amp;#39;t know. In their comprehensive 2003 study &lt;em&gt;Immobilization Thresholds of Electrofishing Relative to Fish Size&lt;/em&gt;, biologists Chad Dolan and Steve Miranda modeled the way electric currents stun fish
 of different sizes, but caution that &amp;quot;no adequate conceptual system exists to explain the effects of size on electroshock thresholds from the perspective of electric fields.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these studies dealt with animals anywhere near the size of whales. The largest fish in Dolan and Miranda&amp;#39;s study were still quite small. &lt;a href=&#34;http://electrofishing.net/2016/01/23/535/&#34;&gt;This experiment&lt;/a&gt; tested larger fish up to 80cm long,&lt;span&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt; but nothing whale-sized.&lt;span&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt; Since we don&amp;#39;t know exactly why larger fish respond differently, it&amp;#39;s hard to confidently extrapolate.&lt;/p&gt;

gt; of body volume, so for a whale, that would be about 20 megawatts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a catch: Most electrofishing is done in fresh water. Unfortunately, blue whales live in the ocean,&lt;span&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt; where the salt water conducts electricity much more easily. That might seem like good news for our electrofishigt; of body volume, so for a whale, that would be about 20 megawatts.&lt;/p&gt;

ng plans, but it turns out to make it much more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrofishing works best when the water and the target animals are about equally conductive. In highly conductive saltwater, most of the current flows past the animals in the water rather than through them. This means that ocean electrofishing requires much more power. Using our simple extrapolation, instead of 20 megawatts, we might need a gigawatt. In other words, you&amp;#39;ll need to bring a large nuclear generating station.&lt;/p&gt;
